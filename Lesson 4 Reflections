Lesson 7 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use it when you want to share it immediately and want to save yourself the hassle of uploading and committing it manually.

Lesson 10- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to pull manually so it doesn't pull in the middle of editing something.
